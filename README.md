## Introduction
This package is a port of the [php package socrates](https://github.com/reducktion/socrates).

socrates-java allows you to validate and retrieve personal data from National Identification Numbers across the world, 
with the goal of eventually supporting as many countries in the world as possible.

Some countries also encode personal information of the citizen, such as gender or the place of birth. This package allows you to extract that information in 
a consistent way.

It can be useful for many things, such as validating a user's ID for finance related applications or verifying a user's age without asking for it explicitly.
However, we recommend you review your country's data protection laws before storing any information.

## Usage
Socrates provides two methods:
* `validateId`, which returns a boolean indicating if an id is valid in a specific country
* `extractCitizenFromId`, which returns an Optional `Citizen` with information retrievable from the identifier (gender, date of birth, ...)

The list of supported countries is available via the `Country` enum.

### validateId
```java
final Socrates socrates = new Socrates();
socrates.validateId("15420355 6 ZX9", Country.PT); // true
```

### extractCitizenFromId
```java
final Socrates socrates = new Socrates();
final Optional<Citizen> citizen = socrates.extractCitizenFromId("2820819398814 09", Country.FR);
citizen.ifPresent(c -> {
  c.getGender().ifPresent(System.out::println);       // "FEMALE"
  c.getYearOfBirth().ifPresent(System.out::println);  // "1982"
  c.getMonthOfBirth().ifPresent(System.out::println); // "8"
  c.getDayOfBirth().ifPresent(System.out::println);
  c.getPlaceOfBirth().ifPresent(System.out::println); // "Corr√®ze"
});
```

#### Gender
`Gender` is an enum that represents the gender of the `Citizen` extracted from the ID. It can have the values `FEMALE` or `MALE`. However, you can get the
short hand "F" and "M" for `FEMALE` and `MALE` respectively, by using the method `getShortHand()` present in the class.

## Supported Countries
You can find a list of supported countries [here](COUNTRIES.md).
